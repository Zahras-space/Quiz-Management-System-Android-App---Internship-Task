# Quiz-Management-System-Android-App---Internship-Task
The Quiz Management System is an Android application built using Kotlin that provides two portals: a Teacher Portal and a Student Portal. 
Teachers can create, edit, and manage quiz questions by adding multiple-choice questions with options and correct answers, all stored in a centralized repository. 
Students, on the other hand, can access the quiz and attempt questions in a simple and engaging interface, with their responses evaluated against the correct answers. The app demonstrates clean architecture, using MVC, by separating concerns with repositories, activities, and data binding. 
This project showcases core Android development concepts, including activity lifecycle management, UI design with ConstraintLayout, and user interaction handling, making it a practical learning and assessment tool.
